So you want to learn a new language. Students usually start by learning vocabulary and work up to grammar. Once you have a word bank to pull from and a structure to place them in, voilà—you can convey a meaningful message.

Mastering a language and becoming fluent takes more work, but basic sentences can be strung together with the right recipes of simple vocabulary and grammar. The same can be said for coding languages, which work in a similar fashion.

In language learning, syntax is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. In programming, syntax is the set of rules that define the structure and format of a language, dictating how symbols, punctuation, and words must be arranged to form valid instructions that a computer can understand and execute.

VS Code acts as an interpreter and guide in this process. In my experience, it has been very convenient and beginner-friendly. With its built-in features such as IntelliSense and GitHub Copilot, creating initial scaffolding, debugging errors, and exploring unfamiliar syntax becomes much more streamlined and less intimidating. Rather than constantly searching through documentation, I can learn patterns directly through suggestions and feedback.

ESLint functions more like a strict language teacher. It provides immediate feedback for stylistic and structural issues, not just errors that would crash the program. ESLint has made sure that my syntax is not only correct, but also consistent and readable. While this sometimes feels tedious, especially when a small formatting issue causes multiple warnings, it has forced me to be more intentional about how I write code instead of just whether it works.
