At UH Manoa, in SLS480E: Language Learning with Apps our final project was to design and create a application that would help second language learners. My app, Keigo Zoo focuses on Keigo, Japanese honorific speech. Keigo (honorific Japanese) is a culturally nuanced part of the Japanese language. The mastery of Keigo is essential for anyone who wants to interact respectfully and integrate into Japanese society. However, post-beginner Japanese second language learners have a difficult time learning Keigo through traditional means such as the classroom. 

Keigo Zoo will adapt to the level of the post-beginner user by allowing options such as romaji, furigana, and definitions for kanji. By integrating explanations, hints, and constructive feedback during the quiz section, users can get real-time feedback that helps correct their misunderstandings, internalize cultural nuances, and improve their ability to use Keigo appropriately. 

Fully conceptualizing Keigo requires understanding Japanese social hierarchy, humility, politeness levels, and situational context (the “atmosphere”). Keigo Zoo helps learners to understand this cultural context by recreating situations in different environments and guide the users to understanding. It explains the cultural and linguistic context behind each form of speech. Keigo Zoo fills a critical gap in the Japanese-learning ecosystem outside of a formal classroom.
